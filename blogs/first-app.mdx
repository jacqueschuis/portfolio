I have not shied away from the fact that I am a self-taught developer. I followed Colt Steele's famous Udemy course, and in the end, I had a [full stack application to show for it](/blog/from-yelpcamp-to-museo).

Museo was, of course, the end result of my course. Along the way, I built countless little exercises demonstrating fundamental ideas of web development. The exercise that made everything click for me, though, was a simple random color generator, which was the project that made me fall in love with development.

Read on for more information on how I took a class exercise into a fully functional widget application.

## Overview

## The assignment

If you are also a student of Colt's, then this assignment is first introduced in Section 25 ('The Missing Piece: DOM Events'), leson 263. It is then expanded upon in Section 29 ('Prototypes, Clases, & OOP').

Initially, this lesson is about event handlers. You make a simple button that runs a function to generate a random RGB color and set the button's background color upon being clicked. Later on, you expand this into a constructor function as a brief introduction to object-oriented programming.

That's where Colt stops, though. I remember getting to this lesson, copying over the code and seeing the app respond to my click and just being mesmerized. I knew I wanted to go deeper, and I felt ready to make an app out of a snippet of code:

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const newColor = makeRandColor();
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = newColor;
  h1.innerText = newColor;
});

const makeRandColor = () => {
  const r = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
  const g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
  const b = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
  return `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`;
};
```

## Expanding/V1

Dealing with an RGB color was easy enough, but I decided to set myself a personal challenge of allowing for random HEX color generation and translation between HEX and RGB.

_Note: at the time, I was very into HEX, although I now favor HSL—expect a blog post about this soon._

It turned out that HEX was a lot more complex to generate randomly, and I ended up writing extremely long functions to handle generation and translation. I would add the original snippets in here, but they are so long that it would take up too much space. If you want to see the V1 functions, click [here](https://github.com/jacqueschuis/simple-color-generator/blob/ef0394400cd6d564f087bc1f6124a969af78355f/app.js).

I remember being so incredibly proud of my solution. It was my first programming problem that I had solved completely on my own, and it played a large part in keeping my momentum up as I moved through Colt's course.

## Constructor/V2

After watching Colt's lessons on OOP and constructor functions, which he explicitly tied back to the random color exercise, I decided I should refactor my code to use a constructor as well, which allowed me to simplify things greatly. Where my initial version had seperate functions for making a new HEX color vs. making a new RGB vs. making light variations and so-on and so-forth, this one had one neatly packaged object `Color`, which would contain all the necessary functions.

This made the code easier to read and understand, and I had cut my `app.js` lines of code almost completely in half! I was happy enough with this version of the app to let things sit for a few months:

## Next steps

This color generator is the first app that I ever built. As I was following along with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp, there was a project to build a simple RGB color generator, demonstrating the basic ideas behind DOM manipulation with vanilla JS. I built this alongside him, and then I gave myself the challenge to make this work with Hex colors as well. To simplify the code, I ended up making a class constructor function to handle all things color (which goes deeper than is currently used here). Based on this Color function, I can then easily set the text of the app.

I initially built this in the fall of 2022, but I revisited in summer 2023, rehauling the design of the app to fit with my current style. All of the same functionality is there, but things are (I'd like to think) much clearer now, and the code is simpler and more efficient than it was previously.

I've added a show/hide button, as well as event handlers to show/hide individual color names. I have added integration with the Clipboard API that allows you to copy the entire palette or just individual colors, and I use set timeout functions to show temporary messages when colors are copied. Initially, this was just an exercise in DOM manipulation, but now I would say that it is a self-contained and both functional and usable app for anyone looking to generate a simple monochromatic color palette.

## Challenges

### Redesign

Because I had set the app down for quite a long time, revisiting it was a little tough. I hadn't made my functions very clear, and it took me a good bit of experimenting to find out exactly what I was doing. I changed the functions to rely on a constructor for Colors, and this clarifies things immensely.

I also am revisiting this after building my portfolio in React and Tailwind, so going to Vanilla JS and Bootstrap again took a second. I had to reference the docs (especially for Bootstrap) very frequently, and eventually, I would like to bring this app into the Tailwind world.

## Things to Add

1. Add features

This app is very simple. You make a 3-stop monochromatic scheme with the click of a button, which definitely serves its purpose, but it is not the comprehensive tool which I would like it to be. I would like to add options for different color schemes (i.e., complementary, tertiary, triadic, etc.)

2. Download scheme

I would like to be able to export the scheme card to an image that the client can download for referencing later.

3. History

I would like there to be some sort of history functionality whereby the app remembers your 5 or so most recent colors, and there's an option to save/pin these using local memory.

4. Transfer the app to a new framework

To deal with the added complexities which I would like to add, I will likely need this to be built on a framework, like React.
