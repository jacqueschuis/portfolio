## Overview

## What is Frontend Mentor?

[Frontend Mentor](frontendmentor.io) is a challenge website that allows you to "improve your front-end coding skills by building real projects."

A challenge can be divided into three steps:

1. Choose a challenge

You can pick from a broad range of [challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)—all filterable by difficulty, languages/skills involved, and price.

2. Complete your challenge

This is a big step! You are given a set of design files—screenshots of different dynamic states/error messages/viewport sizes/etc. From this, you build. Most challenges come with "Ideas to test yourself" (which are largely the same between challenges). The most growth will come from _setting your own goals/rules._

3. Submit your solution

You submit your solution to the Frontend Mentor platform—complete with a link to a Github repository and a live demo. From here, you gain points towards getting listed on the [hiring platform](https://hiring.frontendmentor.io/). You can also receive comments and likes from other developers on Frontend Mentor, helping give it a sense of community. I received really helpful critique on [my tip calculator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-tip-calculator-with-vanilla-js-and-css-ziYZ3zbj_m#feedback) which inspired a refactor that led to a much more successful final solution.

### Free vs. Premium

Much of the content on Frontend Mentor is available for

### Should you use it?

Definitively, **yes**! Whether you are at a loss for new project ideas, want to flex your web-dev fundamentals, or just want to build something quickly, Frontend Mentor is great. I have learned a lot from it, and I would highly recommend it to developers of all skill-levels.

## My completed challenges

To date, I have completed 3 Frontend Mentor projects: [Age calculator](#age-calculator), [CSS landing page](#css-landing-page), and [Tip calculator](#tip-calculator)

### Age calculator

</div>

#### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See focus states for all interactive elements on the page

#### My take

### CSS landing page

</div>

#### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

#### My take

While I think this is the least impressive at first glance of the challenges I completed, it is probably the one I am the most proud of. The only asset for this design was the 4 photos. Everything else is illustrated completely with vanilla CSS.

Prior to this project, I had only dabbled lightly in CSS. I hadn't _dared_ to make a full landing page—especially a very complex landing page—with just CSS.

### Tip calculator

#### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
